# javascript-challenge
For this challenge, I used Javascript, HTML and the D3.js library to create a webpage that displayed a full table of information when clicked, as well as a series of forms that can filter it by most columns. To make sure the user knows at least one matching value to use in these columns, I made sure to add placeholder text in each form indicating one possible correct answer. To complete this homework, I had to first figure out how to create and populate an HTML table by linking to the datafile using a script (app.js) to fill each row. From there, it was relatively easier to create each form. Although the website is fairly primitive in appearance, I like to think it looks like most actual conspiracy/UFO sites.

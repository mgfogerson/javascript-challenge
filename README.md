# javascript-challenge
For this challenge, I used Javascript, HTML and the D3.js library to create a webpage that displayed a full table of information when clicked, as well as a series of forms that can filter it by most columns. To make sure the user knows at least one matching value to use in these columns, I made sure to add placeholder text in each form indicating one possible correct answer. 

  To complete this project, I had to first figure out how to create and populate an HTML table by linking to the datafile using a script (app.js) to fill each row. From there, it was relatively easier to create each form. Although the website is fairly primitive in appearance, I like to think it looks like most actual conspiracy/UFO sites.
  
  As well, the user can filter the UFO sightings by date, allowing for a finer-toothed approach to the uncovering of cosmic secrets. Because the dataset is from a while ago, a suggestion of 1/1/2010 is automatically the grey text in the search form.
